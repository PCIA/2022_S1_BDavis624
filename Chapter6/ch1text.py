text = """The first thing that stands between you and writing your first, real,
piece of code, is learning the skill of breaking problems down into achievable
little actions that a computer can do for you. Of course, you and the computer
will also need to be speaking a common language, but we'll get to that topic 
in a bit.
Now breaking problems into a number of steps may sound a new skill, but it's 
actually something you do every day. Let's look at an example, a simple one: 
say you wanted to break the activity of fishing down into a simple set of 
instructions that you could hand to a robot, who would do your fishing for 
you. Here's our first attempt to do that, check it out:

You're going to find these simple statements or instructions are the first key 
to coding, in fact everyApp or software program you've ever used has been
nothing more than a (sometimes large) set of simple instructions to the computer
that tell it what to do."""
